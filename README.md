***You walk into a pub...***

* Waiter is a kid, new to this job, and easily intimidated
* Mini-games available
  * Darts
  * Someone in the pub puts up a coin, puts a coin in the box and cranks the 'BIAB'
  * Bard-in-a-box (jack in the box) like a lute with one string, primitive music
  * If you hit the goblin, you get everything in the pot, or if nothing, your money back and a free drink

## DM Stuff

* Have a player do the recap  
* Give options: Ramp up the violence/tension, or de-escalate?
* Remind players of important details from previous sessions
